# 📚 Entries Folder: The Journal Proper

Welcome to the published core of the Sinople theme—where stitched thoughts, semantic resonance, and symbolic constructs come to rest as finalized content.

## ✍️ What Goes Here?

Entries represent **complete journal artifacts**, including:

- **Field Notes** – Observational posts steeped in texture and moment
- **Threaded Archives** – Essays organized by motif or emotional thread
- **Construct Narratives** – Symbolic characters explored in context
- **Glossed Essays** – Posts with embedded annotations and conceptual depth
- **Portals** – Reflections on external sites, ideas, or signal flares
- **Metadata Files** – JSON-LD or RDFa structures that accompany entries

These pieces are stylistically polished and semantically grounded—ready for rendering, reading, and referencing.
