# 🧶 Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.  
This project follows a “threaded” versioning system inspired by narrative iteration.

## [0.1-threaded] — 2025-07-21

### Added
- Initial theme scaffold: `style.css`, `functions.php`, `index.php`
- `README.md` with poetic structure and IndieWeb integration
- Accessibility features: skip links, dark/light toggle, font scaling
- Semantic folder with `metadata.jsonld` and draft `sinople.ttl`
- Licensing (GPL v3 / CC BY 4.0)

### Intent
Stitched the first veil of *Sinople*—resistance, mist, and memory embodied in a CSS-first foundation.
