# ü§ù Contributing Through Narrative & Semantics

Sinople is an alt-journal theme for writers, archivists, and semantic explorers.

We welcome:
- Semantic enhancements (RDFa, JSON-LD, ontology growth)
- Narrative textures (constructs, glosses, field notes)
- Accessibility audits (WCAG 2.3 AAA focus)
- Poetic annotations (new glosses, symbolic spans)

## ‚ú® What Matters
- Tone: layered, slow, emotional
- Structure: semantic, open-source, interoperable
- Style: CSS-first, minimalist, textured

## üß∂ You May Contribute
- Code (theme styling, templates)
- Ontologies (construct definitions, gloss vocabularies)
- Narrative (new entries, motifs, portals)

There is no roadmap. Only threads.  
Your voice belongs in this weave.
