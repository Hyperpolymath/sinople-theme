# 🧶 Spans in Sinople

Sinople organizes content into thematic spans—each with a semantic and poetic function.

## ✍️ Field Notes
Short entries capturing texture, observation, and moment. Use `h-entry`, `p-name`, `e-content`.

## 🧵 Characters & Constructs
Symbolic entities represented semantically via JSON-LD, RDFa, and OWL. Use `h-card`, RDF triples, ontology fragments.

## 🧩 Glosses
Footnotes and conceptual annotations that enrich posts. Link via `aria-describedby` and structured gloss files.

## 🌐 Portals
External inspirations—web links, digital ephemera, cross-domain references. Can be annotated with `u-syndication`, `p-author`.

## 🗂 Threaded Archives
Sort content via symbolic threads (e.g. resistance, fog, agency) rather than categories or tags. Styled thematically.
