# 🧶 What Is This Folder?

This is the creative drafting space for Sinople.  
It holds early ideas, unfinished threads, metadata scaffolding, and fragments not yet woven into published entries.

## 🧵 How Is This Different from `entries/`?

| Folder      | Purpose                              | Status            |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `content/`  | Conceptual drafts, semantic pairings | In progress, exploratory |
| `entries/`  | Finalized, published journal posts   | Public-facing, stylistically complete |

Treat this folder as your foggy shoreline—where emotional echoes and symbolic threads first take shape.

## ✒️ What Belongs Here?

- Markdown drafts (`fog-breathing.md`)
- HTML experiments (`veil-trace.html`)
- JSON-LD blocks (`fog-breathing.jsonld`)
- RDFa snippets
- Annotations and gloss drafts

You can pair each creative span with a semantic file for testing before moving to `entries/`.
