# Field Note: Fog Breathing

Woke up to a wet silence.  
The mist thickened overnight, weaving the rooftop and the doorway together like stitched breath.

Eteri passed through at 06:22. I recognized her thread—quiet urgency, veiled defiance.  
Her coat shimmered with memory and resistance.  
Glosses:  
- `Fog Threading`  
- `Veiled Agency`  

She left no footprints.  
Only a ripple in the window’s condensation, shaped like a question.
