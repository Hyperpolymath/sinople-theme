# 🧶 Contributing to Sinople

Thank you for considering a contribution to *Sinople Journal Theme*, where every line of code and span of poetry is stitched with care.

## 🪡 What We're Looking For

- Accessibility enhancements (ARIA roles, WCAG adjustments)
- IndieWeb compatibility (microformats, Webmention display)
- Semantic structure (RDFa, JSON-LD, FOAF integration)
- Narrative or visual additions (new constructs, glosses, textures)

## 🧠 Philosophical Intent

Contributions should align with Sinople's ethos: emotional depth, decentralized publishing, ethical design, and poetic ambiguity. There is no roadmap—only threads. 

## 📐 Code Style

- Use semantic HTML and ARIA whenever possible
- CSS-first philosophy: minimal JS, maximum clarity
- Format PHP according to WordPress coding standards
- Inline documentation is welcomed—especially when narrative or symbolic

## 🌐 Semantic Structure

If adding structured data:
- JSON-LD preferred
- Schema.org, FOAF, or custom vocabularies supported
- Turtle/OWL files versioned in `semantic/`

## 🧵 Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`feature/aria-toggle`, `span/luna-metadata`)
3. Submit a pull request with a description of your intent

Contributions may be technical, narrative, or purely symbolic.
