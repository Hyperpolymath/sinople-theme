# ðŸŒ¿ Sinople Journal Theme

**Alt-journal WordPress theme for the fog-bound, stitched, and emotionally intricate. Built CSS-first with WCAG 2.3 AAA compliance, IndieWeb integration, ARIA-rich semantics, and structured data via JSON-LD and Open Graph. A vessel for storytelling, resistance, and poetic presence.**

## ðŸ§¶ Overview

*Sinople* is a narrative environment for layered expression. It's named after a heraldic pigment once red, now greenâ€”an emblem of contradiction and agency. This theme transforms WordPress into a mist-soaked loom for thoughts, threads, and constructs. CSS-first by design, it privileges performance, readability, and symbolic structure while embracing radical inclusivity and decentralized publishing.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **CSS-First Architecture**  
  Fast-rendering, mobile-responsive, fully declarative stylesheets. Minimal JS footprint for accessibility enhancements only.

- **WCAG 2.3 AAA Compliance**  
  Visible focus indicators, skip links, font controls, dark/light mode toggle, motion sensitivity respect, and semantic HTML throughout.

- **ARIA & Semantic HTML**  
  Meaningful landmarks (`main`, `navigation`, `banner`), structured role attributes, and keyboard navigation tailored for all readers.

- **IndieWeb Integration**  
  - Microformats v2: `h-entry`, `h-card`, `p-name`, etc.  
  - Webmention ready  
  - Post Kinds support (note, reply, bookmark)  
  - POSSE and `u-syndication` links

- **Structured Metadata Layer**  
  Uses **JSON-LD with schema.org** for search engine clarity and semantic depth. Entities are expressed via `@graph` blocks and can later be extended with FOAF or SKOS vocabularies.

- **Open Graph Metadata**  
  Embedded in `<head>` to ensure rich previews when posts are shared across social platforms. Complements structured data with visual affinity.

- **Spans & Constructs**  
  Native support for:
  - *Field Notes*: observational micro-essays  
  - *Characters & Constructs*: symbolic entities like *Eteri Mistveil*  
  - *Threaded Archives*: entries sorted by color, emotional tone, or mythic motif  
  - *Glosses*: footnotes with `aria-describedby`  
  - *Portals*: annotated external inspirations
